For DLLs (download gcc-winx64 from sourceforge by daniel starke, move files into the "bin" folder after extractions and run! note the files from sourceforge might be dangerous as ive not verified them):

g++.exe -shared -O3 -o scanner.dll scanner.cpp -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
and
g++.exe -shared -O3 -o forcer.dll forcer.cpp -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++

or (however the method above is recommended and stable)
g++.exe -shared -o scanner.dll scanner.cpp -Wl,--subsystem,windows 
and
g++.exe -shared -o forcer.dll forcer.cpp -Wl,--subsystem,windows 

For main.py 

python v3.13.7 (add to PATH !)
then run in command prompt:
pip install pywin32 psutil pymem

NOTE: main.py and the DLLs must be in the same directory/folder to work.
